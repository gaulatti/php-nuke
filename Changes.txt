June 2005: Version 7.8
======================
- Improved the banners administration system. Now you can set Ads positions, assig banners to a specific position,
  use Javascript and HTML code banners, use Flash (.swf) banners, now you must specify width and height of your
  Flash and Images advertising. To use the new ads system you should use the following code:
  $ads = ads(1);
  echo "$ads";
  Change the number "1" for the position you want to use in that particular space. By default, the new advertising
  system uses position 0 and 1. Position 0 is called "Page Top" to include ads in the header and great
  for Top of the page ads like the standards 468x60. Position 1 by default is called "Left Block" and is used from
  the block file blocks-Advertising.php
  With this system you can use Google's AdSense, Fastclick, TribalFusion, DoubleClick, etc... etc... in the way
  you want. Text Links ads are also supported. Just know that Javascripts/HTML code and Flash banners can count
  the impressions but not the clicks.
- IMPORTANT: Removed the file banners.php and replaced with two functions included in mainfile.php
  Please update your themes and/or modules that makes use of banners.php to start using the new ads system.
- Removed banners configuration from preferences in the administration area. Banners value will always be 1 (active)
  and they will show if exists, otherwise the system will just ignore the ads functions. Banners field in the
  nuke_config table remains present for compatibility with old themes that uses it.
- Upgraded phpBB forums port to version 0.15 (Thanks to chatserv from http://nukeresources.com)
- Updated all files of Private Messages and Members List modules with the latest fixes (Thanks to chatserv from http://nukeresources.com)
- Removed the javascript code check if you're in the administration area. Admins should be able to use scripts
  code on their sites without any restrictions.
- Moved PHP error control report from mainfile.php to config.php (Default is 0 for no error display)
- Removed all @ to the require and include functions to let the error control works as it should

- All blocks in the admin panel can now be previewed (active or not)
- Added a new define('NO_EDITOR') method to remove the wysiwyg editor if you don't want it on a specific area
  use it as:
  define('NO_EDITOR', 1);
  just before including the header.php. On this way the wysiwyg editor will not load on that page
- Function makePass() has been moved from Your_Account module to mainfile.php because it's of common use

April 2005: Version 7.7
=======================
- Added Users Karma System. This system lets you edit the karma of any user and restrict content publication to
  anyone that's annoying you and your visitors. There are 4 Karma values, as follow:
  0: Good Karma (Default value for all users)
  1: Regular Karma (Marked with a red flag, user activity isn't restricted but you need to pay atention)
  2: Bad Karma (Marked with a warning icon. All comments of this user are moderated from the admin panel, these
     users are notified that their comments are moderated)
  3: Devil Karma (Very bad/evil user. All comments from this user are ignored, never published, without any notice)
  Additionaly Users marked with Bad and DEvil Karma can't post comments in Downloads nor Web Links modules.
  Moderation of bad Karma users comments are done using a new administration module called: Moderation.
  It's in your hands and discretion to use or not this system. Karma system will help to have a little more
  control over abusers.
- Reviews module comments for anonymous users is now subject to the general preferences of the system.
- IP Ban system has been modified to use * wildcard in the last digits of any IP address. Know that if you ban
  an IP using a wildcard as the last digit you're banning a complete Class C network (255 IP addresses). Be
  careful using it and do as an extreme measure.
- Journal module textarea fields size increased to fit the new WYSIWYG editor layout
- Comments moderation system now works at 100% in both News and Surveys modules
- Comments moderation form submit button replaced with a block with information on how to moderate and a text
  button instead. This is for both News and Surveys modules.

  options can't be changed. This to increase site's security and to minimize possible mailbomb attacks.

- Enhanced the backend.php output by adding <description> field to the generated RSS feed.
- Added new database support for SQLite, which is a database server included with PHP5. (Thanks goes to phpBB team)
- Added new constant (MODULE_FILE) to modules.php to define a module instead to check if the module has been loaded
  by module.php. Old method still compatible but encouraged to use the new one. For examples see the first lines
  of any included module. (Thanks to Chatserv from http://www.nukeresources.com)
- Added a great WYSIWYG text editor to ALL PHP-Nuke's textarea fields. Compatible with Mozilla, MSIE and FireFox.
  For this was used the great tinyMCE made by MoxieCode Systems AB (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com). TinyMCE is free
  software released under the LGPL. All credits are untouched on the files (/includes/tinymce/).
  You don't need to do anything if you want your module to use the editor, it automaticaly replaces all and any
  <textarea> tags all over the place with the wysiwyg editor. This is what I call "easy of integration". Better
  configuration, implementation and cosmetic changes will come in future releases.
- Added graphic icons to all administration functions (edit, delete, activate, deactivate, add, show, etc).

- Fixed SQL injection vulnerability in FAQ module
- Fixed SQL injection vulnerability in Search module
- Fixed a bug in admin logout function cookie removal (Thanks to Loris)
- All credits headers in the source has been remade the way they should be. Non big changes to the code will
  have their credits on this file or in the piece of code changed instead of main header. I had files sent by
  users that for even a single character it carries a copyright note. If a file was "based" on others work or if
  the file has considerable changes or a partial rewrite it will have the credits on the header, otherwise the
  credits should go embeded on the modified code or in this file. This is to have a little more order. Source
  headers were out of control until now.
- All .php files has been indented to make the source code more human readable.
- Increased topicimage field length in nuke_topics table from 20 to 100 (Thanks to mtougeron for the suggestion)

November 2004: Version 7.6
==========================
- According with the email number 213080 to Dave Turner (GPL Compliance Engineer) from the Free Software Foundation,
  the copyright notices of PHP-Nuke has been changed in order to be 100% compliant with the GPL license section 2(c).
  This copyright notices can't be removed and the Commercial License becomes 100% compliant with the GPL license.
  Hope this is the end of the story for the people that doesn't understand a bit of the GPL. Again, if you want to
  legaly remove the copyright notices from PHP-Nuke generated pages you must purchase the Commercial License, see
  http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=Commercial_License for more details and stop complaining about this issue, the
  Commercial License is legal, GPL compliant and approved by the Free Software Foundation. End of story.
- Fixed administrator edit function that didn't show the authorized modules to administer. (Thanks to jaggura from http://www.whereiroost.com)
- Added FireFox (http://firefox.com) browser support for site's counter that will show in Statistics module.
- Added RSS feed support for FireFox browser's Live Bookmarks.
- By popular demand and to avoid some administration system non-authorized entries attempts, now you can just rename
  the file admin.php to whatever_you_want.php and set the name in config.php file. Doing this nobody knows what's
  your administration filename. Additionaly a new method of URL redirection has been added to hide the referer when
  you click on a link inside administration system. If you have old administration modules not compatible with this
  new system you'll get "Access Denied" message. If this is the case, leave the admin.php file with its original name
  while you modify the modules or get a new compatible version of it.
- Added a new folder called /includes/custom_files where, if exists the files custom_mainfile.php, custom_header.php and
  custom_footer.php they will be included from mainfile.php, header.php and/or footer.php respectively. Also the
  file /includes/my_header.php has been removed and added the new /includes/custom_files/custom_head.php for anything
  that should be between <head> and </head> html tags in the code. With this feature will be more easy to update
  a site without lost your custom changes. These files will not be shipped with PHP-Nuke to avoid possible overwritting
  when updating the code. (Thanks to André V. Escudero for the tip)
- Moved Forums administration to the module's folder (Thanks to Chatserv from http://www.nukeresources.com)

January 2004: Version 7.1
=========================
- Added Subscription system. With this new feature you can now manage subscriptions to your site. Mainly
  designed so webmasters can have subscribed users who pay to be able to remove advertising and/or access
  to subscribers only modules. The subscription system lets you set any block of the site to be invisible
  for subscribed users, any module can be configured to grant access to subscribed users only and the
  banners system will not show any advertising if the user is subscribed. A new function called paid() will
  check if the user is subscriber or not. If you want to make some part of the code available for subscriber
  users only, you must use the following piece of code:

  if (paid()) {
     echo "You're a subscribed user...";
  }

  you can also check if a user isn't a subscriber using the code:

  if (!paid()) {
     echo "You're NOT a subscribed user...";
  }

  So, with this you can play a little. But to configure a module for subscribed users only, just use the
  modules administration option as usual, see the new option in the "Who can view this" selection box.
  Messages system also can be used on the same way. To subscribe a user, he/she must be registered on the
  site, then as administrator go and edit the user's account. You'll notice the new options to
  subscribe/unsubscribe anyone you want in periods from 1 year to 10 years. The system is created to manage
  anual subscriptions only, but I think it's as it must be. Also, in Your_Account module, in the main
  window the user will always know how many time remains in his/her subscription. Remember to edit the
  config.php file and set $subscription_url variable with the subscription information page on your site.
  Enjoy and make some money with your site! :) Hope you like it.

  different modules for each theme. How? Just create a "modules" directory inside a theme's directory and copy
  your new modules there. For example: If you want the theme NukeNews to have its own custom News module,
  you need to have a directory "/themes/NukeNews/modules/News" and the News replace on it. The system will
  automaticaly detect and load it instead of the default "/modules/News". Remember to fix all your path in the
  module files. See Sand_Journey theme directory for an example with Addon_Sample module.

- Now each theme can load its own default home module. Just create a module.php file under the theme's
  directory with the variable $default_module on it. For an example please see Sand_Journey theme. It loads
  News module. Try changing the default home module from administration and notice that the News module
  continues to be loaded in the homepage only for this theme. If you don't want to have or use this feature
  just don't have any module.php file in your theme's directory.

  You can still use as usual, or you can call it like: http://phpnuke.org/backend.php?cat=themes
  The above URL will show the XML formated file only with "themes" category. Note the variable "cat". So
  now people from other sites can retrieve from your site only the news they have really interest in.
  Of course that this feature will works only if you have set one or more news categories for your site.
- Changed the password generator function in Your_Account due to problems in some systems.
- Automatic installation added. Not more sql server shell commands to install. Just edit your config.php

  as a valid theme with this new feature.
- List of users benefits from Your Account module in new user registration page is now updated automaticaly
  depending on what you have active and for registered users only.
- Added new feature to have theme sensitive topic's graphics (in /themes/your_theme/images/topics/). Default topics
  graphics need to be on usual place (/images/topics/) but if the system find the existence of the files in the
  theme's images directory it will show it instead. This was higly requested feature. Themes files need to be
  modified to have this feature working. Please look at the included themes to have some samples.

  different icons for user's menu and WebMail if the graphics files exists and if not the system will
  load the default graphics. Refer to some themes like 3D-Fantasy, Odyssey, ExtraLite, Sand_Journey and NukeNews
  to see the difference and look at the new /images/directory structure. Basicaly /images/menu/ and /images/webmail
  will load the user's menu and WebMail icons respectively if specific file names exists. Take a look.
  All new icons are used with author's permission, please see CREDITS file for more information.
- Added a new link metatag to configure the browser icon for your site. To have it working you need
  to have a file called favicon.ico inside /themes/your_theme/images/ directory.

- Detailed statistics now count and show the new impression when accessing it.

  can have three more files: survey_leftbar.gif, survey_mainbar.gif and survey_rightbar.gif If you don't have them
  the system automaticaly selects the usual bars files (leftbar.gif, mainbar.gif and rightbar.gif). Additionaly you
  can have another file called "survey_mainbar_d.gif" (see the "_d"). This graphic, if exists, will be added each
  25% in the survey bar. This can help you to decorate your Survey bars. Statistics bars are the usual ones. Try it!
- Fixed user session save function before show left blocks
- Solved the looooong dilema about Module's Copyright information. There is a new file called "copyright.php"
  in the module's directory. Please take a look at /modules/Addon_Sample/ and see this file. Modules/Addons
  developers can edit this file filling the required data and then copy this file into your module's directory.
  To see it working just go to Addon Sample module and look the little copyright stick at the bottom right of
  the module's table. If you don't put this file into the module's directory nobody will see that stick. Hope
  users play fair on this and solved a big user's issue about the copyright messages.
- Added 5 new themes and changed the default one from NukeNews to Sand_Journey
- Added a very nice feature to allow registered users to publish Public Messages which will be available in any
  page of the site to other users for a period of 10 minutes. Each message can be viewed just one time per user
  and any registered user can also turn off this feature from its preferences page. To have this feature working
  you need to use the new function "public_message()" located in mainfile.php and need to be added where you want
  it in your themes files. The function returns $public_msg with all the needed stuff (table, colors, message, etc).
  You can see samples of how to use it by viewing the default system themes. All themes that comes with PHP-Nuke 6
  supports this feature.

February 2002: Version 5.5
==========================
- Added a very cool function to check if a module is activated. Call it: is_active("Module_Name");
  Returns 1 if active or 0 if not. Use the module "title" in the database to make the check
  This will help in the future to really integrate all modules with the core system and to establish
  some dependencies between parts of the site.

  require_once("mainfile.php");
  $module_name = basename(dirname(__FILE__));
  get_lang($module_name);
