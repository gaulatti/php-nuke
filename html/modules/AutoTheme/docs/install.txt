Installation
There are two main ways to install AutoTheme.  Regardless of which way you choose, it is important to remember that the compressed distribution file (.zip, .tar.gz or .sit) contains all of the directories and files needed and it is laid out in the exact manner that it should be installed.  There is no need to create directories or worry about the proper placement of files.


FTP
As most hosting providers supply FTP access, this is likely the most common way to install CMS modules, including AutoTheme.

* Extract the compressed distribution file (.zip, .tar.gz or .sit) to your local computer
* FTP upload the entire contents to your CMS root directory (accept any directory overwrite warnings.  These directories are not being overwritten.  The warnings are generated because the directory already exists, but this is fine.)


Shell
If your hosting provider supplies Secure Shell (SSH) or Telnet access, this may be a quicker and easier installation method.

* Copy the compressed distribution file (.zip, .tar.gz or .sit) to your CMS root directory (the main directory where your CMS is installed)

* Extract the compressed distribution file
	* unzip file.zip  (zip example)
	* tar zxf file.tar.gz  (tar.gz example)

After installing, go to your CMS/shop Administration, and follow the instructions for activating a something like AuToTheme.


File Permissions
IMPORTANT:  The "modules/AutoTheme/autotheme.cfg" and any "theme.cfg" in your theme directories, as well as the themes/ directory itself must be writeable by the web server in order to use the graphical administration interface!
Template compiling increases the speed of your site and requires that "modules/AutoTheme/_compile/" be writable.
Full page caching greatly increases the speed of your site and requires that "modules/AutoTheme/_cache/" be writable as well.

The easiest way in Unix/Linux with shell access is to change to the CMS root directory and then:

* CHMOD 777 modules/AutoTheme/autotheme.cfg
* CHMOD 777 modules/AutoTheme/_compile/
* CHMOD 777 modules/AutoTheme/_cache/
* CHMOD 777 themes/YOURTHEME/theme.cfg
* CHMOD 777 themes/

To set the permissions on all applicable files, you may use the following shell script:

* sh modules/AutoTheme/autotheme.sh

If using FTP, most FTP programs have an option to set these permissions on files.  Windows should not be an issue unless you have set custom file or directory permissions.
